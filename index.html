          <img src="assets/dog2-sq.jpg" alt="Dog 2" />
          <p>
            First rule of being a dog: sniff everything! You never know when you'll find a hidden treasure, like a delicious old sock.
            Nap like a pro—anywhere, anytime. Bonus points if you curl up in the sunniest spot in the house.
            Always greet your humans with maximum tail wags and a happy dance, even if they just went to the mailbox.
            Bark at squirrels with gusto! It's a noble mission, even if those sneaky critters always escape.
            Remember, if it fits in your mouth, it's definitely a chew toy—even if your humans don't agree!

            Hi, I'm a super fluffy, four-legged treat lover who's always on a mission to find the perfect stick. 
            I've got the best nose in the world, which means I can smell bacon from a mile away—seriously, try me! 
            My tail is like a happiness meter, wagging extra fast when I see my favorite humans or a squeaky toy. 
            I'm a professional napper, especially in cozy spots where the sun hits just right. 
            And don't let my puppy eyes fool you—I'm an expert at convincing humans to share their snacks!

            So, let me tell you about us dogs—we're basically the best! 
            Our noses are like super sniffer machines, able to detect even the tiniest whiff of bacon from way across the house. 
            We come in all shapes and sizes, from the teeny-tiny Chihuahuas who think they're big shots to the giant Great Danes who are basically horses. 
            We're all about making friends, whether it's playing fetch, going on walks, or just snuggling up with our favorite humans. 
            And don't even get me started on how good we are at reading your emotions—we know when you need a cuddle or just a goofy grin.
